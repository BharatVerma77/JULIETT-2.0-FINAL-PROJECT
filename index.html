        <p>Since users can only interact with your app or website through the UI, its design will determine their main impressions. If you’ve tried any low-effort app or website you’ll know exactly how frustrating it can be to deal with a badly designed UI. Apps are now competing for users’ time, so you don’t have long to impress a user. In fact, according to Localytics, 71% of all app users churn within 90 days.</p>
        <p>User interface designers bring a creative edge to the project, making your app or website stand out amongst the millions of other options out there. Even if you’re following a broader template of what a ride-hailing app or booking website should look like, creative UI design is how you can stand out.</p>
